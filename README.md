This project presents the analysis and design tasks performed on the IEEE 39-bus
(New England) test system using PSAF (Power System Analysis Framework). The
tasks include load flow analysis, frequency response analysis, and voltage stability
assessment, among others. The system's nominal frequency is 50 Hz, and the data
provided includes bus, line, transformer, generator, and load information.
